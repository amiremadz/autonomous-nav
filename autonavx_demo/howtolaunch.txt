From the forum post by BSam:
Step 1: Download the zip file: autonav.in.tum.de/autonavx_demo.zip
Step 2: Unzip to a directory, then navigate into the directory
Step 3: While still inside the directory, run this command (keep it running):
(Python 2.x)
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
(Python 3.x)
python -m http.server
Step 4: Open the browser, go to URL: localhost:8000/test.html
Verify the web server is running:
For SimpleHTTPServer the following text should appear to let you know its running: "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ..."
Pinging localhost can be another way to see if its running, there should be a reply.
ping localhost
